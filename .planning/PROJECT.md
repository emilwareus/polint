# polint

## What This Is

polint is a high-performance Rust framework for writing repo-local static-analysis rules across multiple languages. Adapters today cover **Go** (tree-sitter) and **TypeScript / JavaScript** (Oxc); more languages can be added through the same adapter contract. It initially supports Go and TypeScript/JavaScript and gives rule authors reusable infrastructure for file discovery, parsing, typed facts, diagnostics, local rule execution, and CI output.

The product is for engineering teams using AI-assisted development who need executable project-specific policies instead of repeating local conventions in prompts. It is not a replacement for ESLint, Ruff, Biome, golangci-lint, or formatters; it is a framework for checks that those generic tools cannot know.

## Core Value

Make it easy to express a repo-specific engineering policy as a small rule and run it locally, in CI, and with AI coding agents.

## Current State

v1.0 MVP shipped on 2026-05-02. It includes the Rust workspace, CLI/config/discovery loop, deterministic core facts and diagnostics, Go and TypeScript/JavaScript adapters, SDK and self-contained example-local rules, cache/performance support, CI output, README/examples, and final release verification.

Phase 11 of v1.1 completed on 2026-05-09. Declared rule capabilities now produce an internal deterministic `AnalysisPlan`, the child rule host passes that plan to Go and TS/JS adapters before harvesting, adapter cache keys include the plan digest, and unsupported reserved capabilities produce structured `polint/capability` diagnostics.

Phase 12 of v1.1 completed on 2026-05-11. Syntactic Go and TS/JS imports now flow into setup-aware resolved import facts and module/file/package/dependency graph facts exposed through typed SDK views for repo-local architecture rules.

Phase 13 of v1.1 completed in May 2026. `Symbols<'_>` and `References<'_>` are available through the SDK, with Go and TS/JS symbol/reference facts, stable IDs, and precision tiers.

Static-analysis engine research completed on 2026-05-16. `research/ROADMAP.md` defines the long-running implementation sequence for the private analysis kernel, evaluation harness, cache substrate, semantic backbone, interprocedural engine foundations, extension surface, precision layers, benchmark gates, and SDK/query promotion path.

Phase 20 of v1.2 completed on 2026-05-16. Current source, Go syntax, TS/JS syntax, module graph, symbol graph, and metrics orchestration now runs behind a crate-private analysis kernel facade with deterministic internal provider manifests and test-only provider-order inspection, preserving existing public behavior.

Phase 21 of v1.2 completed on 2026-05-17. Existing kernel-produced fact families now carry crate-private sidecar metadata for provenance, precision, confidence, validation status, stable keys, and deterministic merge validation, with internal debug JSON for files/imports/symbols/references and no public metadata surface.

Phase 22 of v1.2 completed on 2026-05-17. polint now has a crate-private internal evaluation harness MVP with deterministic expected/observed JSON, total-order report normalization, output hashes that exclude transient runtime data, generic matchers, unified metrics, and native fixtures covering kernel, provenance, cache, and extension invariants, with no public CLI, SDK, runner, or check JSON surface.

Phase 23 of v1.2 completed on 2026-05-18. polint now records internal input snapshots, typed cache/query/summary/diagnostic keys, provider output metadata, cache stats, and lifecycle/toolchain/rule/model digest inputs needed for correct cache invalidation, with no new public surface.

Phase 24 of v1.2 completed on 2026-05-18. Existing cheap fact layers now persist through a crate-private layer cache for Go and TS/JS syntax, imports, module graph, symbol/reference, and metrics providers, with dependency indexes, change sets, deterministic hit/miss reporting, stale-reuse safeguards, and public no-leak proof.

Phase 28 of v1.2 completed on 2026-05-20. polint now has private semantic MIR and normalized place identity for Go and TS/JS function bodies, with deterministic lowering snapshots, explicit unsupported semantic rows, provider/cache/debug/validation wiring, internal eval coverage, and public no-leak proof.

Phase 30 of v1.2 completed on 2026-05-21. polint now records private direct call-site, target, and unresolved-call facts with deterministic indexes, provider/cache/debug/eval wiring, direct target resolution from precise semantic references, explicit unresolved statuses, native fixture coverage, and proof that public whole-program `CallGraph<'_>` remains unsupported.

Phase 31 of v1.2 completed on 2026-05-21. polint now has a private P0 abstract-domain kernel with law-tested lattice contracts, deterministic local solving over MIR/CFG/calls, conservative transfer behavior for uncertainty and budgets, provider/cache/validation/debug/eval wiring, native abstract-domain fixture coverage, and proof that abstract-domain internals do not leak through public SDK, CLI, runner, README, or docs/facts surfaces.

v1.2 Static Analysis Engine Implementation shipped on 2026-05-27. It delivered the full private static-analysis engine substrate from the research roadmap: kernel scheduling, provenance, internal evaluation, cache identity and persistence, semantic backbone, MIR, CFG, calls, abstract domains, summaries, demand queries, extension sinks, framework/trust facts, type/value/alias precision layers, refined calls, data flow, slicing/evidence, benchmark promotion gates, and bounded public SDK/query ergonomics.

v1.3 Graph Engine Precision completed in June 2026. It delivered the private shared semantic graph, reachability/root semantics, Go semantic frontend and RTA driver, JS/TS inventory and function-token/object-model drivers, adaptation models, solver budgets, unknown taxonomy, and promotion gates needed to make graph precision measurable while keeping solver internals out of the public SDK.

Static Analysis 2.0 research was locked on 2026-07-07. It clarifies that the core products remain `polint check` for custom Rust rules and `polint review` for agentic review, while the long-term product promise is a local semantic layer that lets AI agents understand, explore, and improve large codebases. The locked technology direction is an embedded SQLite/rusqlite local semantic store with typed graph indexes, registry-ready summary manifests, Tantivy lexical search, deferred vector search, and no remote package-summary registry in the first implementation.

## Current Milestone: v2.0 Static Analysis 2.0 Implementation

**Goal:** Build the Static Analysis 2.0 implementation foundation that turns polint's existing private analysis engine into a durable, queryable local semantic layer for custom Rust rules, agentic review, and future local graph exploration.

**Target features:**
- SQLite/rusqlite local semantic store skeleton with migrations, manifest, generation tracking, and private store facade.
- Durable persistence for validated facts, graph adjacency/evidence indexes, summaries, provenance/status metadata, and invalidation dependencies.
- Registry-ready package summary manifests and content-addressed payload seams, without building a remote registry yet.
- Local CLI graph/query foundations for used-by, neighbors, callers/callees, paths, taint-style reachability, filters, and agent-shaped JSON envelopes.
- Tantivy lexical-search boundary over stable semantic-store document IDs, with vector search deferred behind explicit model/chunker/provenance lockfiles.
- Deterministic validation gates: cold/warm parity, crash/recovery behavior, query correctness fixtures, budget/unknown preservation, and benchmark coverage.
- Strict public-boundary discipline: store tables, raw graph internals, provider IDs, parser IDs, and SQL remain private until intentionally promoted.

**Source context:** v1.2 built the private analysis substrate, v1.3 improved graph precision, v1.4 promoted policy-query SDK views, and the 2026-07-07 research pass locked the Static Analysis 2.0 product and technology direction. v2.0 starts by making the analysis graph durable and queryable locally while preserving future registry seams.

### Active

v2.0 Static Analysis 2.0 Implementation requirements are approved in `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` (67 requirements: product boundaries, ground-truth benchmarks, pipeline cost discipline, store foundation, metadata/invalidation, summary persistence, warm review payoff, internal query engine, graph CLI, search boundary, validation/recovery/scale) and mapped to roadmap phases 63-71 in `.planning/ROADMAP.md`. The milestone is anchored on falsifiable outcome gates: scale (≤ +20% peak RSS / +25% cold wall-clock regression budget over the store-disabled baseline), latency (warm `polint review` recomputes only the instrumented invalidation frontier), honesty (unknown/budget states durable end to end), and accuracy visibility (persisted-graph recall baseline recorded, not raised). Phase 70 (Tantivy lexical search) is the designated scope-cut.

### Out of Scope

- Becoming a comprehensive bundled lint ruleset - the product value is custom rule infrastructure.
- Replacing existing language linters or formatters - users should keep ESLint, Biome, golangci-lint, rustfmt, and similar tools.
- Full Go type checking in the first pass - leave a trait boundary for a future `go/packages` or `go/analysis` sidecar.
- Full dynamic branch coverage in the first pass - design the model so exact coverage can be added later.
- Fully automatic compilation/loading of repo-local Rust rules in the first pass - scaffolding, SDK, and native registration are sufficient for v1.
- Perfect semantic precision in the first implementation of every capability - v1.2 should expose precision tiers and useful facts incrementally instead of pretending all dynamic or setup-sensitive behavior is exact.
- Public broad analysis APIs before validation - v1.2 should keep new analysis modules private by default and promote only deliberately scoped SDK/CLI contracts.
- Replacing current user behavior while building the static-analysis engine substrate - existing CLI, SDK, cache, and rule behavior must keep working unless a phase explicitly changes a reviewed contract.
- Running user test suites inside polint by default - coverage should be imported from reports that users or CI already produce.
- Exposing raw language-tool output as the public SDK - rule authors should consume normalized polint facts, not raw `go/packages`, Oxc, Python, javac, Maven, Gradle, or coverage report structures.
- Python and Java parity before Go and TS/JS capability coverage - Go and TS/JS should prove the complete model first; Python and Java start with declared subsets and expand later.

## Constraints

- **Stack**: Rust workspace with Rust 2024 edition - required by the prompt and fits performance/static-analysis needs.
- **Language support**: multi-language framework. Adapters today: Go (tree-sitter) and TypeScript/JavaScript (Oxc). New languages plug in through the adapter contract.
- **Parser choices**: tree-sitter-go for Go and Oxc for TS/JS - requested baseline and current crate ecosystem fit.
- **Performance**: Use deterministic parallelism and avoid cloning large source strings - large repo support is a core requirement.
- **Reliability**: Parser errors and rule panics should become diagnostics or controlled internal errors, not crashes.
- **Truthfulness**: Heuristic rules must say they are heuristic and must not claim exact coverage.
- **Repository layout**: Product code and GSD planning documents live together in the repository root on `main`.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Use the `polint` binary/crate prefix and **`emilwareus/polint`** as the GitHub repository | The product is polint end-to-end; the Rust crates stay `polint-*`. | Accepted (repo rename) |
| Build a smaller complete v1 instead of shallow full breadth | The prompt explicitly prefers working, tested functionality over fake or broad shallow features. | Accepted in Phase 9 |
| Start with a hash-based cache, not Salsa | The prompt allows Salsa to remain behind an abstraction if it slows delivery. A content/config/rule hash cache is simpler to ship safely. | Accepted in Phase 7 |
| Treat repo-local rule auto-compilation as future work | Full auto-compilation is not required for v1; scaffolding and explicit Cargo integration are enough. | Accepted in Phase 6 |
| Use in-repo GSD planning on `main` | GSD runs in this checkout on `main`; avoid worktrees. | Accepted in Phase 1 |
| Close Phase 2 around the first usable CLI loop without overclaiming later commands | `init`, `new-rule`, `check`, config loading, discovery, and JSON output are verified, while experimental debug command ideas remain unpromoted. | Accepted in Phase 2 |
| Treat Phase 3 stable IDs as deterministic within a run | File discovery now sorts root-relative paths before `AnalysisDb::add_file`, and cross-run externally visible identity remains fingerprint-based where needed. | Accepted in Phase 3 |
| Snapshot the JSON diagnostic renderer output directly | Workspace-wide `serde_json/preserve_order` can change `Value` object reserialization order; parseability is still verified separately while snapshots pin CLI-facing renderer output. | Accepted in Phase 3 |
| Keep Go analysis syntax-first and explicit about heuristics | Phase 4 uses tree-sitter facts and conservative error-path heuristics, while full Go type checking and exact coverage remain out of scope for the first pass. | Accepted in Phase 4 |
| Keep TypeScript analysis syntax-first and explicit about heuristics | Phase 5 uses Oxc syntax facts for TS/JS parsing, declarations, JSX, literals, calls, complexity, and import relationship proof, while TypeScript type checking and production module resolution remain out of scope. | Accepted in Phase 5 |
| Keep the SDK additive and rule-author focused | Phase 6 exposes borrowed `RuleCtx` helpers and SDK prelude exports without replacing the core rule contract or adding a query engine. | Accepted in Phase 6 |
| Keep policy rules out of the shipped CLI and examples self-contained | The product is a framework, not a bundled policy pack; each example owns one local rule under `examples/<name>/.polint/rules/` and runs it through a native rule host instead of relying on built-in CLI policies. | Accepted in quick tasks 260502-ehi and 260502-qsd |
| Keep heuristic rule claims explicit and bounded | Phase 6 Go branch/test heuristics include `heuristic` wording and evidence labels, avoiding claims of exact semantic coverage. | Accepted in Phase 6 |
| Keep scaffolded repo-local Rust rules honest and safe | Phase 6 hardens `polint new-rule` against unsafe names and overwrite, while leaving automatic dynamic loading to later phases. | Accepted in Phase 6 |
| Cache parser facts, not full source text | Phase 7 stores diagnostics and extracted fact metadata keyed by content/config/rule/schema inputs, while avoiding cached full source or AST payloads. | Accepted in Phase 7 |
| Use deterministic merge boundaries around Rayon work | Phase 7 parallelizes file reads, adapter parsing, and rule execution where safe, then sorts or restores through deterministic boundaries before emitting output. | Accepted in Phase 7 |
| Treat timing output as local metadata, not benchmarks | Phase 7 timing checks assert only shape/order/nonnegative values and no fixed speedup claims. | Accepted in Phase 7 |
| Keep CI output SARIF-like, not certified SARIF | Phase 8 emits useful SARIF-shaped JSON for CI while avoiding conformance claims beyond the implemented fields. | Accepted in Phase 8 |
| Make README and examples the v1 user-facing documentation surface | Phase 9 completed concise command-oriented docs and examples instead of creating a separate docs site or publishing automation. | Accepted in Phase 9 |
| Fulfill capability promises instead of removing them | The v1.1 milestone should make declared capabilities operational through public facts, setup validation, cache semantics, docs, and external-consumer tests. | Accepted in Phase 11 for planning/cache/diagnostic semantics; remaining fact families continue in later v1.1 phases |
| Keep Go and TS/JS as full-coverage targets before Python and Java parity | The current adapters are the proving ground for the complete capability model; Python and Java should enter through explicit subsets and expand after the model is proven. | Accepted for v1.2 sequencing |
| Own the public fact model even when adapters use language-native tooling | Rule authors should consume normalized polint facts while adapters may use Oxc, `go/packages`, Python tooling, javac, JavaParser, coverage.py, LCOV, or JaCoCo behind the boundary. | Accepted for v1.2 sequencing |
| Build the static-analysis substrate before promoting broad public graph/query APIs | The research roadmap shows kernel, provenance, evaluation, cache, MIR, CFG, summaries, extensions, and benchmark gates must precede stable public advanced query surfaces. | Accepted for v1.2 |

## Next Milestone Goals

v2.0 Static Analysis 2.0 Implementation is the active milestone. See the "Current Milestone" section above and `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` / `.planning/ROADMAP.md` for the scoped requirements and phase plan once generated.

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd-transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? -> Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? -> Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? -> Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? -> Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? -> Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd-complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check - still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope - reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
