# Call Graph Research

This folder is a research package for adding call graph facts to polint without using GSD.

Date: 2026-05-15

Revision: 2026-05-16 bootstrap integration update after
`research/implementation-bootstrap/`.

## Main Finding

There is no single state-of-the-art call graph algorithm that works well across Go, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, Python, and other languages. The practical state of the art is a layered architecture:

1. Emit direct syntactic call sites for every language.
2. Bind names/imports/symbols when the adapter can do so cheaply.
3. Add language-specific dispatch algorithms such as CHA, RTA, VTA, points-to analysis, type tracking, MRO lookup, or JavaScript value-flow.
4. Preserve unresolved and uncertain calls as first-class facts instead of pretending they do not exist.
5. Make precision explicit in every fact and cache key.

For polint, the right next step is not a monolithic "build a call graph"
feature. After the bootstrap research, it is an internal `analysis::calls` fact
family that consumes MIR, places, symbols, direct summaries, and extension sinks.
Public `Calls<'_>` / `CallGraph<'_>` views come later, after validation gates.

The product-specific refinement is that polint should support repo-local call graph models authored by AI agents or rule authors. These models should bind back to native facts, carry provenance, and reduce unresolved calls for the specific codebase instead of forcing the native engine to auto-discover every framework convention.

## Local Clone Policy

All third-party repositories are under `research/call-graphs/repos/`, which is gitignored. The research notes reference exact local paths and commit hashes, but the cloned source is not intended to be committed.
