//! Go RTA acceptance gate (GO-05 success criteria 2, 3, 4 — D-14, D-15, D-16).
//!
//! For each checked-in `tests/eval-fixtures/go-rta/*` (and the polyglot canary) this
//! crate-private gate runs the kernel over the fixture repo, rebuilds the closed Go
//! RTA snapshot ([`GoRtaInputs::from_db`]) plus the points-to `CopyEdge` constraints,
//! drives them through the SAME engine the `polint.solver` provider uses
//! ([`SolverEngine::run_to_solver_output`]), and asserts on the resulting
//! [`SolverOutput`]:
//!
//! - **iteration-cap** (D-14): a deliberately-tight `[solver.go]
//!   max_candidates_per_callsite = 1` in the fixture's own `.polint.toml` cannot admit
//!   the three candidate callees (`Circle`/`Square`/`Triangle.Area`) of the single
//!   `s.Area()` interface invoke, so resolving that callsite latches
//!   [`BudgetStatus::BudgetExceeded`] — the GO-05 criterion-2 proof that runaway
//!   dispatch fan-out is SIGNALLED, not silently dropped.
//! - **interface-dispatch** (D-15): the instantiated-type FILTER (RTA, not CHA) — the
//!   instantiated receiver's method resolves; a declared-but-not-instantiated type's
//!   method does not.
//! - **address-taken** (D-15): a func-value indirect call resolves via the
//!   address-taken set + signature match.
//! - **polyglot Go+TS canary** (D-16): Go RTA edges resolve AND there is no
//!   cross-language interference. The TS half genuinely feeds the shared solver core a
//!   CopyEdge constraint (an aliased local call); the language-agnostic points-to closure
//!   propagates it INTRA-TS, but NO derived edge crosses the Go<->TS boundary, so the
//!   two halves never reach across the language boundary through the shared core.
//!
//! The RTA edges are sourced from the kernel-built `AnalysisDb` (`solver_derived_edges`
//! /`GoRtaInputs`), NOT through the call-graph projection. GRAPH-05 wires solver
//! edges into `refined_calls`; until then the self-contained engine drive here
//! is the always-runnable proof. A two-run byte-stability check guards determinism.
//!
//! All types stay `pub(crate)`; no `ALLOWED_PRELUDE` entry is added (D-17).
