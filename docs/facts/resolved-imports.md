# Resolved Imports And Module Graph

`ResolvedImports<'_>` and `ModuleGraphFacts<'_>` expose setup-aware import
resolution and module relationship facts to repo-local rules. Rules request
these views as typed parameters in a `#[polint::rule]` function, and polint
derives the `resolved_imports` and `module_graph` capabilities from those
parameters.

Start rules with:

```rust
use polint::sdk::prelude::*;
```

## ResolvedImports<'_>

`ResolvedImports<'_>` is import-centric. It returns one `ResolvedImportFact` for
each syntactic `ImportFact` that polint harvested, including imports that did
not resolve.

Query methods:

| Method | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `all()` | Returns all resolved import facts in deterministic database order. |
| `iter()` | Iterates all resolved import facts. |
| `for_file(file)` | Iterates resolved imports from one source file. |
| `resolved_for_file(file)` | Iterates only `Resolved` imports from one source file. |
| `by_specifier(specifier)` | Iterates resolved import facts whose syntactic import path exactly matches `specifier`. |
| `unresolved()` | Iterates imports with `Unresolved` status. |
| `dynamic()` | Iterates imports with `Dynamic` status. |
| `unsupported()` | Iterates imports with `Unsupported` status. |
| `unresolved_for_file(file)` | Iterates non-resolved imports from one source file. For running relationship rules this means `Unresolved`, `Dynamic`, or `Unsupported`; `SetupMissing` is reported as a capability diagnostic before rule execution. |
| `for_import(import)` | Returns the resolved import fact for a syntactic `ImportId`. |

`ResolvedImportFact` fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `id` | Stable ID for this analysis run. |
| `import` | The syntactic `ImportId` this fact came from. |
| `from_file` | Source file containing the import. |
| `target_node` | Resolved module graph node, when one exists. |
| `status` | `ResolutionStatus` for the import. |
| `precision` | `ResolutionPrecision` for the result. |
| `reason` | Optional `UnresolvedReason` for uncertain results. |

## ModuleGraphFacts<'_>

`ModuleGraphFacts<'_>` is graph-centric. It exposes normalized file, package,
module, and external dependency nodes plus relationship edges between them.

Query methods:

| Method | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `nodes()` | Returns all `ModuleNode` records in deterministic order. |
| `edges()` | Returns all `ModuleEdge` records in deterministic order. |
| `node_for_file(file)` | Returns the first file node for a source file. |
| `nodes_for_package(package_name)` | Iterates graph nodes whose label or source package name matches `package_name`. |
| `edges_from_file(file)` | Iterates outgoing edges from the first file node for a source file. |
| `imports_between(from, to)` | Iterates graph edges from one file node to another when both files have graph nodes. |
| `outgoing(node)` | Iterates outgoing edges for a node. |
| `incoming(node)` | Iterates incoming edges for a node. |
| `dependency_status(edge)` | Returns the `ResolutionStatus` attached to an edge. |
| `reachable_from(node)` | Computes deterministic breadth-first reachability over `Resolved` and `External` edges. |

`ModuleNode` fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `id` | Stable node ID for this analysis run. |
| `kind` | `File`, `Package`, `Module`, or `External`. |
| `label` | Repo-relative path, package name, module label, or external package label. |
| `file` | Source `FileId` for file nodes. |
| `package` | Source `PackageId` when the node comes from a package fact. |
| `language` | Language family when the node is language-specific. |

`ModuleEdge` fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `id` | Stable edge ID for this analysis run. |
| `from` | Source `ModuleNodeId`. |
| `to` | Target `ModuleNodeId`. |
| `import` | Syntactic `ImportId` when the edge came from an import. |
| `resolved_import` | `ResolvedImportId` when the edge came from a resolved import fact. |
| `kind` | `Contains`, `Imports`, or `DependsOn`. |
| `status` | Resolution status for dependency edges. |

## Status, Precision, And Reasons

`ResolutionStatus` is the main control point for architecture rules:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `Resolved` | Target is a repo file, package, or module node. |
| `External` | Target is outside the repo, including standard library and package-manager dependencies. |
| `Unresolved` | Resolver setup existed, but no target was found. |
| `SetupMissing` | Required resolver setup was absent or failed; requesting relationship rules receive `polint/capability` diagnostics and do not run. |
| `Dynamic` | Import shape is dynamic and cannot be resolved statically. |
| `Unsupported` | Language or import form is known but not implemented. |

`ResolutionPrecision` currently includes `ExactFile`, `Package`,
`ExternalPackage`, `Heuristic`, and `None`.

`UnresolvedReason` currently includes `NotFound`, `SetupMissing`,
`DynamicExpression`, `UnsupportedLanguage`, `UnsupportedImport`, `ResolverError`,
and `OutsideWorkspace`.

## Setup-Sensitive Behavior

- TS/JS resolution uses `oxc_resolver` with project-aware settings such as
  package metadata, extension aliases, and `tsconfig` discovery.
- Go resolution uses the same `[languages.go]` lifecycle as symbol/reference
  facts: module roots are inferred from discovered Go files or declared with
  `module_roots`, package patterns are interpreted inside those roots, and a
  temporary internal `go.work` is used when needed.
- Standard library imports and package-manager dependencies are reported as
  `External`.
- `Unresolved`, `Dynamic`, and `Unsupported` imports remain visible as facts to
  running relationship rules instead of being dropped.
- `SetupMissing` is surfaced through `polint/capability` diagnostics for
  requesting rules, and those rules do not execute with placeholder relationship
  facts.

## Limits

These facts are useful for architecture policies, but they are not a full
semantic graph:

- no TypeScript type checking
- no Go type checking
- no symbols
- no call graph
- no CFG
- no coverage
- no dataflow or taint analysis
- no project-level graph cache
- no public exposure of raw `oxc_resolver` output, `go list` JSON, absolute
  resolver paths, AST nodes, or graph internals

More precise symbol, call, CFG, coverage, and dataflow facts are later fact
families. Rules should treat uncertain `ResolutionStatus` and
`UnresolvedReason` values as part of the contract rather than as errors.
